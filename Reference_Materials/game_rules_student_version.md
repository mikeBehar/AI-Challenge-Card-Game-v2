### ⚠️ Risk Assessment Cards (12-15 minutes)
**Challenge:** Identify risks using the 6-part framework

**What you do:**
- Analyze the AI system systematically
- Find risks in ALL 6 framework categories
- Rate severity (High/Medium/Low) for each
- Show comprehensive analysis

**The 6 Categories:**
1. Data Quality
2. Transparency & Explainability
3. Testing & Validation
4. Governance & Oversight
5. Scope & Safeguards
6. Context & Equity

**Tips:**
- Cover all 6 categories (required!)
- Multiple risks per category
- Justify severity ratings
- Use framework terminology

## How the Game Works

### 1. Form Teams (3-5 students)
- Assigned by instructor
- Work together throughout game
- Contribute to discussion
- One response per team

### 2. Receive Challenge Card
- Read scenario carefully
- Discuss as team
- Plan response together
- Designate someone to write

### 3. Work Time (varies by card type)
- Use full time available
- Quality > Speed
- Show your thinking
- Check your work

### 4. Submit Response
- Written in shared document OR
- Verbal presentation (debates)
- Submit before time ends
- Can't revise after submission

### 5. Grading & Feedback
- Instructor grades immediately
- Announces score (0-10 points)
- Gives brief justification
- Reveals answer (if applicable)

### 6. Learning Moment
- See what you missed
- Understand better approaches
- Connect to course concepts
- Improve for next round

## Team Collaboration Tips

### Good Teamwork:
✅ Everyone contributes ideas
✅ Listen to all perspectives
✅ Build on each other's thoughts
✅ Divide work efficiently
✅ Check each other's reasoning

### Avoid:
❌ One person dominating
❌ Going with first idea without discussion

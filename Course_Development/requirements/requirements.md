### Instructor
Mike - Instructor at CT State Norwalk Community College

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Apply ethical frameworks** to complex AI deployment decisions in business contexts
2. **Evaluate trade-offs** between business objectives and ethical considerations (bias, fairness, environmental impact, alignment)
3. **Utilize AI tools strategically** to inform decision-making under uncertainty
4. **Articulate stakeholder perspectives** through formal role-play and advocacy
5. **Assess consequences** of AI-related decisions across multiple dimensions (financial, reputational, social, environmental)
6. **Craft effective AI prompts** that surface actionable insights and reasonable alternatives
7. **Deliberate collaboratively** to reach consensus on contested issues
8. **Reflect critically** on their own AI usage and decision-making processes

## Pedagogical Framework

### "Fear, Hate, and Love" Trilogy Approach
This course builds on the instructor's established framework that examines AI through three lenses:
- **Fear**: Risks, harms, and concerns about AI
- **Hate**: Critical analysis of AI's negative impacts
- **Love**: Benefits, opportunities, and positive applications

The simulation integrates all three perspectives, forcing students to navigate the tensions between them in realistic business scenarios.

### Core Methodology: Board of Directors Simulation

Students serve as board members for different companies across four case studies. They must:
1. Analyze case materials independently
2. Prepare positions using AI tools
3. Advocate for their positions in live board meetings
4. Vote on critical decisions
5. Experience consequences (both intended and unintended)
6. Reflect on outcomes and their decision-making processes

## Assessment Philosophy

### Three-Stage Assessment Per Case

**Stage 1: Pre-Meeting Preparation (Blackboard)**
- Students read case study
- Answer 3-4 open-ended analytical questions
- Submit AI prompts they would use to inform their position
- State preliminary vote with rationale
- **Purpose**: Assess individual analysis, prompt quality, ethical awareness

**Stage 2: Board Meeting Participation (Live Session)**
- Students advocate positions during WebEx session
- Engage in deliberation with peers
- Cast votes via Google Form
- **Purpose**: Assess communication, persuasion, collaboration

**Stage 3: Post-Consequence Reflection (Blackboard)**
- Review what actually happened (consequences revealed)
- Reflect on decision quality
- Analyze which AI advice was helpful/misleading
- **Purpose**: Assess learning, metacognition, ethical reasoning

### Assessment Rubric Weighting

For prompt and written work assessment:
- **Prompt Sophistication**: 35%
  - Asks the right questions
  - Seeks actionable insights
  - Requests multiple alternatives
  - Specifies needed context
  
- **Ethical Awareness**: 35%
  - Considers multiple stakeholders
  - Recognizes potential harms
  - Weighs competing values
  - Anticipates unintended consequences
  
- **Business Acumen**: 30%
  - Practical and realistic
  - Considers organizational constraints
  - Addresses feasibility
  - Connects to business outcomes

### Grading Distribution (Proposed)
- Pre-meeting assignments (4 cases): 40%
- In-session participation: 20%
- Post-consequence reflections (4 cases): 30%
- Ethics Tribunal participation: 10%

## Case Study Design Principles

### Structural Requirements

Each case must include:
1. **Realistic business scenario** grounded in actual AI ethics dilemmas
2. **Multiple reasonable positions** (no obviously "right" answer)
3. **Clear stakes** with measurable consequences
4. **Ethical tensions** aligned with course themes
5. **Uncertainty** - incomplete information, ambiguous data
6. **Time pressure** - decisions can't wait indefinitely

### Industry & Functional Diversity

Across 4 cases:
- Different industries (finance, healthcare, tech, retail, etc.)
- Different functional areas (HR, Marketing, Sales, R&D, Finance, Operations)
- Different company sizes (startup, mid-size, enterprise)
- Different stakeholder groups affected

### Consequence Design

**Stochastic Outcomes**:
- "Right" decisions can still have negative consequences
- "Wrong" decisions may sometimes work out
- Unexpected second-order effects
- Surprise events (competitor actions, regulatory changes, public backlash)

**Multi-Dimensional Impact**:
- Financial performance (revenue, costs, stock price)
- Brand reputation (customer sentiment, media coverage)
- Employee morale and retention
- Regulatory scrutiny
- Competitive position
- Social/environmental impact

### Ethical Dimensions to Integrate

All cases should touch on multiple themes:
- **Bias & Fairness**: Disparate impact, algorithmic discrimination
- **Environmental Costs**: Energy consumption, carbon footprint
- **Labor Impacts**: Automation, job displacement, working conditions
- **Privacy & Surveillance**: Data collection, monitoring, consent
- **Safety & Alignment**: System reliability, value alignment, control
- **Transparency & Explainability**: Black boxes, accountability
- **Power & Equity**: Who benefits, who is harmed, distribution of value

## Ethics Tribunal Component

### Purpose
Give students opportunity to embody different stakeholder perspectives and argue from positions they may not personally hold.

### Structure
- 6-8 stakeholder roles (self-selected)
- Formal role-play format
- Each role presents position on case outcome
- Group deliberates on "what should have been done"
- No vote - focus on understanding perspectives

### Potential Roles (Case-Dependent)
- Affected Worker Representative
- Shareholder/Investor
- Regulatory/Government Official
- Customer/Consumer Advocate
- Ethics Officer/Philosopher
- Technology/Engineering Lead
- Community/Environmental Representative
- Executive/CEO Perspective

### Role Selection Process
- Students choose roles (first-come, first-served)
- If multiple students select same role:
  - They collaborate if they agree
  - Their votes/positions nullify if they disagree
- Encourages strategic role selection

## Success Metrics

### For Students
- Improved prompt sophistication over 4 cases
- Increased consideration of stakeholders
- More nuanced ethical reasoning
- Greater comfort with uncertainty
- Enhanced AI literacy (when to trust/question AI)

### For Instructor
- High engagement in board deliberations
- Rich discussions surfacing real dilemmas
- Authentic use of AI tools
- Meaningful learning from consequences
- Positive course evaluations

### For Course Design
- Cases generate genuine disagreement (no landslide votes)
- Students report cases felt realistic
- Adequate but not overwhelming workload
- Clear connection between decisions and consequences

## Constraints & Considerations

### Time Constraints
- Only 4 sessions (9 total hours)
- Must balance content delivery, simulation, and reflection
- Cannot afford technical difficulties eating into time

### Student Capacity
- Non-technical audience (no coding, minimal stats)
- Busy professionals (limited prep time between sessions)
- Diverse business backgrounds (may need context setting)

### Online Delivery Challenges
- Building rapport and trust remotely
- Ensuring equal participation
- Managing technical issues
- Preventing multitasking/disengagement

### Grading Efficiency
- 17 students × 4 cases × ~4 questions = ~272 assessments
- Need clear rubrics and efficient workflows
- Balance rigor with sustainability

### Ethical Teaching Considerations
- Avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes in cases
- Ensure diverse representation in scenarios
- Create psychologically safe space for disagreement
- Model ethical reasoning without imposing views

## Unique Innovations

This simulation distinguishes itself through:

1. **Prompt Assessment Focus**: Rather than just asking students to use AI, we assess the quality of their prompts - teaching them to be better AI collaborators

2. **Stochastic Consequences**: Outcomes aren't deterministic based on "correct" choice, teaching humility and systems thinking

3. **Triple Assessment Loop**: Pre-work, live participation, post-reflection creates multiple learning opportunities

4. **Functional Area Rotation**: Each case emphasizes different business functions, broadening perspective

5. **Ethics Tribunal Integration**: Formal role-play component adds depth to stakeholder analysis

6. **Adult Learning Design**: Respects professional experience, builds on prior knowledge, emphasizes application

## Future Enhancements (Post-Pilot)

Potential additions for future iterations:
- Guest speakers from industry
- Student-designed cases (capstone option)
- Multi-session cases with evolving scenarios
- Competitive elements between student "companies"
- Real-time AI integration (bot board members?)
- Quantitative analysis of decision patterns
- Published case studies from simulation

# Unresolved Issues & Open Questions

## Design Decisions Needed

### Case Development
- [ ] **Case continuity**: Should consequences from one case affect the next? (e.g., company reputation carrying over)
- [ ] **Complexity escalation**: Should cases get progressively harder, or maintain consistent difficulty?
- [ ] **Industry diversity**: How much variety? All private sector, or include nonprofit/government?
- [ ] **Decision options**: Always 4 choices (approve/reject/delay/modify) or vary by case?

### Ethics Tribunal
- [ ] **Timing**: Run tribunal at end of each session or consolidate into Session 2 & 4?
- [ ] **Assessment**: Should tribunal participation be graded separately?
- [ ] **Role rotation**: Can students switch roles between cases, or commit to one perspective?
- [ ] **Conflict resolution**: If role holders deadlock, how to break tie?

### Voting & Analytics
- [ ] **Vote visibility**: Show live results during meeting, or keep hidden until reveal?
- [ ] **Abstentions**: Allow abstain votes, or force a choice?
- [ ] **Vote changes**: Can students change vote during discussion, or lock in pre-meeting?
- [ ] **Google Forms vs. Blackboard**: Final decision on which tool for what data?

### Assessment & Grading
- [ ] **Participation credit**: How much weight on in-session advocacy vs. written work?
- [ ] **Prompt iteration**: Do students submit one prompt or can they refine/resubmit?
- [ ] **AI tool variety**: Should students be required to use multiple AI tools across cases?
- [ ] **Peer evaluation**: Include peer assessment of board contributions?

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] **Recording sessions**: Are WebEx sessions recorded? Privacy implications?
- [ ] **Breakout rooms**: Use WebEx breakouts for small group prep before full board vote?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Any accommodations needed for diverse learner needs?
- [ ] **Time zones**: Are all students in same time zone?

### Consequence Design
- [ ] **Randomness level**: How stochastic should outcomes be? (e.g., "right" decision can still have bad outcome)
- [ ] **Feedback timing**: Next-day email vs. next session start?
- [ ] **Consequence depth**: Just financial, or also narrative (news articles, stakeholder reactions)?
- [ ] **Win conditions**: Is there a "best" outcome, or intentionally ambiguous?

## Questions for Mike

1. **Case 2 focus**: Which ethical issue for Session 2? (Options: product ethics, data privacy, algorithmic transparency, AI-generated content)

2. **Grading load**: With 17 students × 4 cases × 3-4 questions each, that's ~200+ prompt assessments. Need efficiency strategies?

3. **Guest speakers**: Any interest in bringing in real-world practitioners for context?

4. **Final assessment**: Beyond case participation, any capstone project or final reflection paper?

5. **Student teams**: All decisions individual, or form committees within board?

## Technical Questions

- [ ] **Blackboard assignment limits**: Any character/file size limits on prompt submissions?
- [ ] **Google Forms**: Need separate form per case or reusable template?
- [ ] **Data export**: How to efficiently export Blackboard + Forms data for analysis?

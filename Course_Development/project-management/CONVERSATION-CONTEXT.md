# AI Business Case Studies - Conversation Context

## ⚠️ CRITICAL COURSE INFORMATION (Updated November 27, 2025)

**Repository Name**: `ai-business-case-studies` (renamed from ai-society-simulation)

**Actual Course**: "Generative AI for Business and Creative Professionals"  
**NOT**: "AI in Society" (that was the original concept, but course changed)

**Course Details**:
- **Start Date**: November 18, 2025 (Mondays 7-9pm online via WebEx)
- **Cost**: $295
- **Institution**: CT State Norwalk Community College
- **Students**: 17 registered, non-technical professionals (age 35-45, 4-15+ years business experience)
- **Prerequisites**: Most completed instructor's prior AI courses (not required)

## Core Pedagogical Focus

**THIS IS THE KEY**: Course teaches **AI collaboration skills**, not finance/ethics/technical mastery

Students learn to:
- Use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as **thinking partners**
- Demonstrate **advanced prompting techniques**
- Apply AI to real-world business decisions
- Critically evaluate AI's reasoning
- Synthesize AI insights into their own judgment

**What This Means for Case Design**:
- ❌ Don't require students to calculate NPV, build financial models, master ethics theory
- ✅ DO require students to prompt AI effectively to understand financial/ethical/technical implications
- ✅ Assess **prompt quality**, not domain expertise
- ✅ Focus on AI as tool for business decision-making

## Project Overview
Board simulation format where students make AI deployment decisions for different companies across 4 sessions. Each case requires using AI tools to analyze complex business situations.

## Assessment Philosophy

**Updated Rubric (Based on Case 1 Learnings)**:
- **Prompt Sophistication: 35%** - Quality of questions asked to AI, iterative prompting, critical evaluation
- **Business Acumen: 35%** - Practical judgment, organizational realities (increased from 30%)
- **Ethical Awareness: 30%** - Ethics as business risk factor (decreased from 35%)

**Key Insight from Case 1**: Students are sophisticated business thinkers with varying analytical backgrounds. Don't make them do complex calculations - teach them to use AI to understand complex concepts.

## Key Design Principles (Refined After Case 1)

1. **Case-based learning**: Different company/industry each session (Finance, HR, Marketing, Sales, R&D)
2. **Board of Directors framing**: Students vote as board members (simple majority via Google Forms)
3. **AI-partnership emphasis**: Explicit AI consultation during deliberation, assess prompts in real-time
4. **Build-vs-buy dilemmas**: "Control your destiny" theme resonated strongly (vendor dependency matters)
5. **Professional experience integration**: Leverage students' 4-15+ years of real-world knowledge
6. **Inter-participant dialogue**: Structure direct debate, not just instructor-mediated discussion
7. **Progressive complexity**: Case 4 should be significantly harder than Case 1
8. **Consequence scenarios**: Stochastic outcomes teach decision-making under uncertainty

## What We Learned from Case 1 Deliberation

**Transcript Analysis Completed**: 2h18m deliberation with 17 students

**Major Discoveries**:
1. ✅ Students are MORE sophisticated than expected (can handle greater complexity)
2. ✅ "Control your destiny" / vendor autonomy theme resonated powerfully (build into future cases)
3. ✅ Real-world experience adds tremendous value (explicitly invite analogies)
4. ✅ Limited AI tool usage DURING deliberation (need to structure AI consultation breaks)
5. ✅ Limited inter-participant dialogue (need direct debate structure)
6. ✅ Board simulation format works excellently (maintain for all cases)
7. ✅ At least one student changed vote based on deliberation (intellectual humility - celebrate this!)

- Business acumen: 30%

## Voting Flow
1. **Pre-meeting**: Students submit position + prompts on Blackboard
2. **During meeting**: Live vote via Google Form in WebEx session
3. **Post-consequence**: Reflection assignment on Blackboard after reveal

## Ethics Tribunal Component
- Formal role-play with self-selected roles
- Students choose from 6-8 stakeholder perspectives
- If multiple students pick same role and disagree, votes nullify each other

## Session Structure (Proposed)
- **Session 1**: Foundation + Case 1 (AI Hiring Tool - bias/fairness)
- **Session 2**: Case 2 + Mini-Tribunal retrospective
- **Session 3**: Case 3 (Scaling AI - environmental/labor)
- **Session 4**: Case 4 (Crisis Management) + Synthesis

## Current Status
Building Case 1 prototype: Regional bank deploying AI loan screening tool with disparate impact concerns.

## Key Contacts & Tools
- **Platform**: Blackboard Ultra, WebEx, Google Forms
- **Instructor preferences**: Ask clarifying questions before complex answers
- **Repository purpose**: Enable conversation continuity across Claude sessions

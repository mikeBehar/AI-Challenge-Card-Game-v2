## Grading Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Equal Weighting:** All card types worth 10 points max
- **Real-Time Evaluation:** Grade during class for immediate feedback
- **Rubric-Based:** Consistent standards across teams
- **Learning-Focused:** Feedback emphasizes improvement

### Scoring Tiers (All Card Types)
- **9-10 points (Excellent):** Sophisticated, comprehensive, demonstrates mastery
- **7-8 points (Good):** Solid response with minor gaps
- **5-6 points (Fair):** Basic response with significant gaps
- **0-4 points (Poor):** Inadequate or misunderstands task

## Quick Grading Reference

✓ Addresses counterarguments
✓ Uses evidence/examples
✓ Persuasive presentation

### Prediction Cards (10 points) ⭐NEW
✓ Identifies 2-3 sophisticated risks
✓ Explains mechanisms clearly
✓ Shows understanding of systemic issues
✓ Reasoning quality over quantity

### Risk Assessment Cards (10 points) ⭐NEW
✓ 12+ risks across ALL 6 categories
✓ Appropriate severity ratings (H/M/L)
✓ Demonstrates framework mastery
✓ Distinguishes materialized vs. ongoing risks

## The 6-Part Risk Framework

Risk Assessment Cards require analysis across these categories:

1. **Data Quality Risks** - Bias, completeness, representativeness
2. **Transparency & Explainability Risks** - Black box, accountability
3. **Testing & Validation Risks** - Pre-deployment, monitoring
4. **Governance & Oversight Risks** - Accountability, human review
5. **Scope & Safeguards Risks** - Boundaries, safety filters
6. **Context & Equity Risks** - Historical context, disparate impact

## Grading Workflow (Per Round)

### Step 1: Read Response (30-60 sec)
- Read completely, don't skim
- Note strengths and gaps
- Resist scoring until finished

### Step 2: Consult Answer Key (30 sec)
- Check hidden section on card
- Identify what team got right/missed
- Don't treat as exhaustive list

### Step 3: Apply Rubric (30 sec)
- Match quality to tier
- Be consistent with previous teams
- Award appropriate points

### Step 4: Prepare Feedback (20 sec)
- Note 1-2 strengths
- Note 1 improvement area
- Plan 15-20 second explanation

### Step 5: Announce & Teach (60-90 sec)
- State score clearly
- Give brief justification
- Reveal answer (if applicable)
- Connect to learning goals

**Total time per team: 3-4 minutes**

## Common Grading Mistakes

### ❌ DON'T:
- Reward length over quality
- Penalize valid alternatives not in answer key
- Use all-or-nothing grading (10 or 0)
- Change standards between teams
- Skim responses
- Forget to reveal answers

### ✅ DO:
- Value depth of thinking
- Accept sound reasoning
- Use full scoring range
- Be consistent
- Read thoroughly
- Use answers as teaching moments

## Grading Consistency

### Calibration (First 2-3 Rounds)
- Start conservatively
- Establish your range
- Adjust if needed (announce to class)
- Maintain consistency after

### Managing Time
- Use tier matching, don't overthink
- Trust your expertise
- Half-points (.5) for true borderlines only
- Move on confidently

### Edge Cases
**Team identifies valid risk not in key:** Award credit if reasoning sound
**Team misunderstands scenario:** Score what they responded to (usually low)
**Team runs out of time:** Grade what submitted, no extensions
**Technical issues:** Extend only if clearly system fault

## Tracking Scores

### Excel Tracking Template
Use provided template to track:
- Team names/numbers
- Individual card scores
- Running totals
- Performance by card type
- Session averages

### Session-by-Session
- Record scores immediately
- Note standout responses
- Track which cards work well
- Identify struggling teams

### Semester-Long
- Monitor improvement over time
- Identify trends
- Adjust instruction as needed
- Plan final assessments

## Using the Master Rubric

### Before Class
1. Review rubric for card types you'll use
2. Understand scoring criteria
3. Note example responses
4. Have rubric accessible during grading

### During Class
1. Pull up relevant card type section
2. Match response to tier description
3. Consult examples if uncertain
4. Apply consistently

### After Class
1. Note if rubric worked well
2. Identify unclear criteria
3. Suggest improvements
4. Update for next semester

## Special Grading Notes

### Prediction Cards
- Focus on reasoning, not just correct risks
- Award credit for identifying actual materialized failures
- Value mechanism explanation over risk labels
- Accept valid risks not in answer key

### Risk Assessment Cards
- All 6 categories required (minimum 1 risk per category)
- Severity ratings should be justified
- 12+ risks expected for excellent scores
- Framework terminology application matters

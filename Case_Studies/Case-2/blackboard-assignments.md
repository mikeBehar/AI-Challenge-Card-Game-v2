## 📋 IMPORTANT: Review Grading Rubrics First!

**Before starting this assignment**, review the relevant rubrics:

- **[Master Rubrics Document](link-to-rubrics-repo)** - See Sections 1, 2, 5, 6
- **Prompt Quality Rubric** (Section 1) - You'll need this for Question 3
- **Written Analysis Rubric** (Section 2) - You'll need this for Questions 1, 2, 4
- **Self-Assessment Checklist** (Section 7) - Use before submitting

**Quick self-check**: Before submitting, can you honestly say your work meets "Proficient" (80%+) or better on the rubrics? If not, keep refining!

---

## Instructions

You are a member of TrendSetters Retail's Board of Directors. Read Case Study 2 thoroughly, then answer the following questions to prepare for the board meeting.

**Important**: For Question 3, you will submit AI prompts showing how you would use AI tools to inform your decision-making. We want to see YOUR prompts and your critical evaluation of AI's help—not just the AI's responses.

## Question 1: Build-vs-Buy Analysis & Vendor Dependency (10 points)

TrendSetters faces a classic build-vs-buy decision. This case explicitly raises vendor dependency concerns (remember Brad's "control your destiny" argument from Case 1).

**Part A**: Compare Options 1 (Buy Full Vendor) and 2 (Build Internal) on the dimension of **organizational autonomy and control**. What does TrendSetters gain and lose with each option? Be specific about vendor dependency risks.

**Part B**: Brad argued in Case 1 that relying on external vendors to fix your critical problems is risky. Does his principle apply here? Why or why not? What's different about this situation compared to Case 1's Liberty Regional Bank?

**Part C**: If TrendSetters chooses Option 1 (vendor solution), what specific protections should they negotiate in the contract to reduce lock-in risk? Name at least three concrete contractual provisions.

**Grading Note**: 
- This question assesses **Business Acumen** (60%) and **Ethical Awareness** (40%)
- See Master Rubrics Sections 5 and 6
- Strong answers reference specific case details and show practical business thinking

**Writing Guide**: 400-500 words total

## Question 2: Customer Segmentation & Generational Divide (10 points)

The case reveals that TrendSetters serves two distinct customer segments with very different attitudes toward AI personalization and privacy:
- **Under 35**: Want speed, convenience, AI recommendations; less concerned about privacy
- **45+**: Value in-store experience, skeptical of data collection, privacy-conscious

**Part A**: Which option (1-5) is best suited for serving the under-35 segment? Which is best for the 45+ segment? Explain your reasoning with specific features each segment would care about.

**Part B**: Is it possible to serve both segments well with a single approach, or does TrendSetters need different strategies for different customers? If different strategies, how would you implement that?

**Part C**: Dee made an excellent point in Case 1 about generational expectations ("30-year-olds working 70 hours a week aren't going to the mom-and-pop bank"). How does her insight apply to this case? What do younger customers expect from retail AI?

**Grading Note**:
- This question assesses **Business Acumen** (50%), **Ethical Awareness** (30%), and **Prompt Sophistication** (20% - if you used AI to understand customer segments)
- See Master Rubrics Sections 5, 6, and 1
- Strong answers show understanding of market segmentation and customer psychology

**Writing Guide**: 350-450 words total

## Question 3: AI-Assisted Financial & Risk Analysis (10 points)

This question requires you to demonstrate effective AI collaboration for business analysis.

**Instructions**: 

Use an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another) to help you understand the financial and risk dimensions of this decision. Show us your prompting skills and critical thinking.

**Submit**:

1. **Three prompts you used** to analyze this case with AI
   - At least one prompt about financial analysis (costs, ROI, payback period)
   - At least one prompt about risk assessment (what could go wrong)
   - At least one prompt that challenges assumptions or asks "what if" questions

2. **For each prompt, include**:
   - The full prompt text (exactly what you asked)
   - WHY you asked this question (what you hoped to learn) - 2-3 sentences
   - WHAT you learned from AI's response - 2-3 sentences
   - Critical evaluation: Did the AI miss anything important? What would you probe deeper on? - 2-3 sentences

3. **Your synthesis** (150-200 words):
   - Based on AI's help, which option makes the most financial sense over 3 years?
   - What risks did AI help you identify that weren't obvious from reading the case?
   - What did AI get wrong or what assumptions should you question?

**What Makes a Strong Prompt for This Assignment**:

✅ **DO**:
- Provide context: "I'm evaluating 5 options for a $180M retailer..."
- Ask for analysis, not decisions: "Help me understand..." not "What should I do?"
- Request AI to challenge assumptions: "What factors might make Option 2 more expensive than projected?"
- Show iterative thinking: Follow-up questions that build on AI's previous answers
- Explain your purpose: "I'm asking this because I need to understand..."

❌ **DON'T**:
- Ask AI to make your decision: "Which option should we choose?"
- Be vague: "Tell me about AI in marketing"
- Just summarize the case: AI should help you understand, not repeat what's already written
- Accept AI's answer without critical evaluation

**Example of Strong Prompt**:
> "I'm evaluating whether a mid-size retailer should build internal AI capability ($1.2M Year 1, 18-24 months) vs. buy vendor solution ($850K Year 1, 3 months deployment). The vendor solution is faster and cheaper Year 1, but building internal gives us full control and owns IP. Help me think through: What hidden costs might make the 'build' option even more expensive than projected? Consider talent retention, infrastructure scaling, and opportunity costs. Then challenge your own analysis—what might make internal build cheaper than it appears?"

**Example of Weak Prompt**:
> "Compare the costs of the five options."

**Grading Note**:
- This question assesses **Prompt Sophistication** (70%) and **AI Collaboration** (30%)
- See Master Rubrics Sections 1 and 3
- We grade the quality of your PROMPTS, not the quality of AI's answers
- Strong prompts are specific, strategic, and show critical thinking

**📋 Rubric Reminder**: Review Prompt Quality Rubric (Section 1) before writing your prompts!

**Writing Guide**: 3 prompts + explanations + synthesis = approximately 600-800 words total

## Question 4: Your Position & Decision Rationale (10 points)

You will have 2-3 minutes during the board meeting to advocate for your position. This question helps you prepare.

**Part A - Your Vote**: 

State clearly which option you are voting for:
- [ ] Option 1: Buy Full Vendor Solution (CustomerIQ™ Pro)
- [ ] Option 2: Build Internal AI Capability
- [ ] Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Vendor + Internal Team)
- [ ] Option 4: Start Small - Pilot with Vendor
- [ ] Option 5: Enhanced Manual Personalization (No AI Yet)

**Part B - Your Core Argument** (200-250 words):

Articulate the strongest case for your position as if making your opening statement to fellow board members. Your argument should:
- Lead with your most compelling reason (business, competitive, risk, or ethical)
- Reference specific case data (numbers, facts, customer insights)
- Acknowledge the main trade-offs and why they're acceptable
- Address both business logic AND ethical/privacy considerations
- Be persuasive but respectful of other viewpoints

**Part C - Anticipating Opposition** (200-250 words):

Identify the TWO strongest arguments AGAINST your position. For each objection:
1. State the objection clearly (as a smart opponent would make it)
2. Provide your rebuttal (how you would respond during deliberation)

This shows you've thought through counterarguments and aren't just advocating from one perspective.

**Part D - The Breaking News Factor** (100-150 words):

The case mentions that you'll receive breaking news about CustomerIQ mid-deliberation (a privacy breach and FTC investigation). 

**Before you know the details**, how might this type of news affect your position? Would it:
- Strengthen your current choice?
- Make you reconsider?
- Not change your thinking at all?

Explain why. (Note: This tests whether your position is robust to new information or depends on everything going according to plan.)

**Grading Note**:
- This question assesses **Business Acumen** (35%), **Ethical Awareness** (35%), and **Prompt Sophistication** (30%)
- See Master Rubrics Sections 5, 6, and 1
- Strong answers show integration of business + ethics, not treating them separately
- We assess quality of reasoning, not which option you choose

**Writing Guide**: 500-650 words total across Parts B, C, and D

## Academic Integrity Note

This is an individual assignment. You may (and should!) use AI tools to help you think through the issues—that's explicitly what we're asking in Question 3. However:

**Acceptable AI Use**:
- ✅ Asking AI to help you understand financial concepts
- ✅ Using AI to generate alternatives you might not have considered
- ✅ Asking AI to challenge your thinking or identify blind spots
- ✅ Using AI to explain case elements you don't understand

**Unacceptable AI Use**:
- ❌ Having AI write your answers and copying them verbatim
- ❌ Asking AI "What should I answer for Question 1?" and using its response
- ❌ Not synthesizing AI insights into your own words and analysis
- ❌ Unclear what's AI's thinking vs. your own thinking

**The test**: If someone asked you to explain your answer without looking at notes, could you? If you couldn't explain it because AI wrote it, that's a problem.

**Use AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement for your own thinking.**

When in doubt: **Attribute AI's help explicitly** ("I asked Claude about X and learned...") and **synthesize in your own words**.

---

## Connection to Case 1

Several themes from Case 1 (Liberty Regional Bank) appear in this case:

- **Vendor dependency** ("control your destiny" - Brad's argument)
- **Generational differences** in customer expectations (Dee's insight)
- **Privacy vs. business efficiency trade-offs** (similar to bias vs. speed)
- **Build vs. buy decisions** (implied in Case 1, explicit here)

Think about what you learned from Case 1 deliberations and apply those insights here.
